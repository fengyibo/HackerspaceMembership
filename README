Getting Started
===============

Get Python2.6 or Python2.7 (Whatever comes bundled with your system is
preferred, but otherwise 2.7 is better)

Afterwards, you need to get pip and virtualenv (+virtualenvwrapper)

If you want the latest pip+virtualenv
-------------------------------------
Use your local package manager to get easy_install (usually packagename
is python-setuptools).

	$> easy_install pip
	
	... stuff happens

	$> pip install virtualenvwrapper

If you're lazy and want the fast way
------------------------------------
Find python-pip and python-virtualenv and pip install virtualenvwrapper

Setting Up Dev Environment
==========================
The following will set up a virtualenv named 'hicap'.	Feel free to name
it whatever you want.

	$> mkvirtualenv hicap
	$> pip install -r requirements.txt

The next time you return to your machine just type:
	$> workon hicap

The requirements file is in the root of the repo.	It contains a list
of all packages for pip to install.	You might need to run the pip 
install later on when further changes introduce new dependencies.

Running Dev Server
==================
Make sure you're in your virtualenv

	$> python manage.py runserver

You can also be all 'runserver 0.0.0.0:8080' to pick your IP and ports.
Yeah, it's that simple.
